# ADC pin: Analog-to-digital converter on NodeMCU

## What does this circuit do?

On one side there is simple light sensor made from photoresistor, its resistivity depends on light. 
On the second side lays two LEDs. 
When the photoresistor is in the dark, blue LED will light up; when photoresistor in light is, than the green LED light up.
